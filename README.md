# Homework Guide

Each week, your instructor will add instructions for that week’s homework assignment to the class repo and announce that it’s ready. Your instructors and TAs will also provide a demonstration of the homework in the classroom.

## How to Work on Homework

Homework is designed to prepare you for two scenarios that you will encounter as a developer:

* On-the-job tickets or feature requests

* Job-seeking coding assessments or take-home assignments

On-the-job ticket homework will provide you with starter code in a folder called `Develop`. You’ll modify or add to this code to complete the homework. Odd-numbered units follow this format.

Job-seeking coding assessments do not provide starter code. You’ll build these from scratch. Even-numbered units follow this format.
